Django is a web application framework for Python. It facilitiates the building of web sites, supply the developer with development tools, database and web server middleware, and a suite of tools for automating the configuration and tedious parts of setting up a web site. Django supports a MVC (model-view-controller) approach to web development. The data model (models.py) is defined by a set of class definitions, each representing a database table. Static files (HTML, CSS, Javascript) are then sidelined such that the data model and view specifications are decoupled from page design and implementation.

To begin using Python, it is advisable (though not essential) to create a virtual environment. This has several advantages, in particular to avoid dependency clashes, but also to install python packages locally in the absence of administrator privileges.

<pre>
$ pip install virtualenv	
</pre>
